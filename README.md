📌 Overview

This research examines social engineering as a human-centric cyber-attack technique, where attackers exploit psychological traits such as trust, authority, urgency, and fear instead of technical vulnerabilities. The study traces the evolution of social engineering from early impersonation and phishing to AI-driven, deepfake-enabled, and multi-channel attacks used today.

🧾 Abstract

Social engineering is a manipulation-based cyber-attack method that targets the human element, widely recognized as the weakest link in cybersecurity. By exploiting behavioral patterns and psychological biases, attackers bypass technical defenses to gain unauthorized access to systems and sensitive data.
This paper provides an in-depth analysis of social engineering attacks, their historical evolution, modern AI-assisted techniques, predicted future developments, and the significant risks they pose to individuals and organizations.

This paper investigates:

The evolution of social engineering techniques over time

Modern AI-powered and targeted social engineering attacks

Future developments involving AI, deepfakes, IoT, and immersive technologies

Preventive strategies focused on awareness, training, and human defenses
